{"name":"Tincanjs","tagline":"JavaScript client library for TinCan API","body":"### Getting Started\r\n\r\nDownload the build file(s) and load them on an HTML page. Only one of either 'build/tincan.js' or 'build/tincan-min.js' is needed at a time. You *can* link to the individual source files but this is not usually necessary outside of development on TinCanJS itself. The '-min.js' build file has been minified for performance but makes it slightly harder to debug.\r\n\r\n### Basic Usage\r\n\r\nThe following sample shows the most basic usage of TinCanJS.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar tincan = new TinCan (\r\n    {\r\n        recordStores: [\r\n            {\r\n                endpoint: \"https://cloud.scorm.com/ScormEngineInterface/TCAPI/public/\",\r\n                username: \"<Test User>\",\r\n                password: \"<Test User's Password>\"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n);\r\ntincan.sendStatement(\r\n    {   \r\n        actor: {\r\n            mbox: \"mailto:info@tincanapi.com\"\r\n        },  \r\n        verb: {\r\n            id: \"http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/attempted\"\r\n        },  \r\n        target: {\r\n            id: \"http://rusticisoftware.github.com/TinCanJS\"\r\n        }   \r\n    }   \r\n);\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
